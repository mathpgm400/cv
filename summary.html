    <h2>This is the learning summary from the 'HTML Personal site project'</h2>
    <p>All the topics learnt in the current project are summarised below</p>
    <h3>( please format teh notes into nested points )</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML <strong>tables</tables></strong> , most table attributes are
        depricated inorder to encourage the use of CSS for table styling.</li>
      <li><p>HTML <strong>forms</strong>, forms are for user input and data
             collection, we still cannot utilize the full functionality of the
             HTML forms because we havn't yet learnt about JavaScript. So, for
             now in HTML forms,we have to learn about labels, inputs and the
             available inputs types provided by HTML5. Also learnt about input
           tag attributes like such as name, value etc and what they do,
           <strong>mailto:</strong> is what your were looking for and could not
           find on google , searching is a skill in itself. Later format this
           into nested points. What do Form attribute method="get" and method="post"
         do ? how different ?</p> <!--Including line
             breaks like this inline is not the right practice I guess, please
             <research class=""></research> -->
